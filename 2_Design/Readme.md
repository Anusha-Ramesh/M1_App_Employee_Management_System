  - In High level behaverial diagram we the module which shows the functions or the operations carriedout throughout in our project.
  - To start with we have the welcome screen it leads us to the login page.
  - In login page we need to enter username and password.
  - After entering the correct username and password it will direct us to the main menu.
  - In the main menu we have 5 different options i.e add new employee to the existing data, delete the existing data, modify the data, search employee details and some Queries.
  - Employee id, name, designation, branch, gender,salary and phone number are the basic information that are needed to add any employee to the existing table.

  - In low level structural diagram we have the admin.
  - Admin will be directed to login page and he/she can login using user-id and password.
  - Username and password should be entered correctly else it will not lead to the next steps.
